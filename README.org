* Butterfly USAXS
This is a set of modules and functions I've written to analyse Ultra Small Angle X-ray Scattering [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small-angle_X-ray_scattering][(USAXS)]] 
data collected on butterfly wings to study scale ultrastructure.
** Requirements
The scripts require the [[https://github.com/silx-kit/pyFAI][pyFAI]], [[https://peakutils.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html][peakutils]] and SciPy modules for azimuthal integration, and the [[http://www.silx.org/doc/fabio/dev/getting_started.html#introduction][fabio]] module
for handling data of two dimensional X-ray detectors. Matplotlib is required for plotting utilities.
** Execution
The main script ***integrate_ridge_scattering.py*** requires three arguments: 
- An edf file containing the 2D scattering pattern to analyse
- An 'empty' edf file, used to correct for white noise
- A text file containing information on the pixels that mask the position of the beam stop. 
  This information comes in the form of a rectangular matrix with dimensions equal to the dimensions
  of the detector in pixels_{x} \times pixels_{y} with masked pixels set to 0 and valid pixels set to 1.

It is executed as follows:
#+begin_src shell
  ./integrate_ridge_scattering.py sample.edf empty.edf mask.txt
#+end_src

** What it does
The main motivation for the script is the analysis of batches (thousands) of edf frames taken from a large number of samples
at a radiation facility, allowing the rapid identification specific structures in butterfly scales; spacing between ridges
and spacing between cross-ribs. The script first searches for ridges by scanning the image in 5\deg regions.
Upon identification and recording of scattering due to parallel ridges (denoted by 1 in the figure), it moves
 the region of interest by ~90\deg to capture scattering due to cross-ribs (2 in the figure). It then  performs [[http://www.esrf.eu/UsersAndScience/Publications/Highlights/2012/et/et3/][azimuthal integration]] 
over the region of interest to obtain a 1D representation of the data, and exports results for ridge spacing and cross-rib spacing in
separate plain text format files for posterior analyses.

Not all the analysed edf frames contain valid data, this may result from instrument failure or focusing on parts of the sample other than a scale.
In case the edf frame does not contain valid data according to the criteria set in the script, it will be reported as failed.
